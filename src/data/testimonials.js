      "The 6-month online product design course by IOTB was a game-changer for me. Inspired by Seyyid Abdul Rahman Kishky during a discussion after the Skills and empowerment session at the 12th  IOTB/TIMSAN annual conference, I decided to pursue UI/UX design, which perfectly matched my interests in research and aesthetics. With weekly classes led our tutor, Oyedeji Shuaraudeen, we explored key topics, completed assignments, and worked on individual and team projects. I started as a complete novice but graduated with the ability to conduct user research, solve design problems, and create functional digital products—skills that helped me secure an internship right after the program. Two things stood out for me in this programme- our tutor’s commitment and the challenging monthly “village meetings” that kept us motivated. Trust me, you don't want to go to the Village meeting unprepared. I recommend this course to anyone ready to work hard and build a strong foundation for a career in tech.",
